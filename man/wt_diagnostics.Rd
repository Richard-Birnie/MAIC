 intervention individual patient data and the MAIC propensity weights. The

 weights. The default is WT_RS.
@param rs_wt_col The name of the rescaled weights column in the data frame
 containing the intervention individual patient data and the MAIC propensity
 weights. The default is wt_rs}

\item{vars}{A character vector giving the variable names of the baseline characteristics. These names must match the column names in
data.}

\item{intervention_wts}{A data frame containing individual patient data from
the intervention study, including a column containing the weights (derived
using estimate_weights).}
}
\value{
List of the following:
\itemize{
  \item The effective sample size (ESS) as a numeric value.
  \item A data frame that includes a summary (minimum, maximum, median, mean) of the weights.
  \item A data frame that includes a summary of patient characteristics
  associated with each weight value.

Produce a set of useful diagnostic metrics to summarize propensity weights

  \item ESS (\code{\link{estimate_ess}})
  \item Summary statistics of the weights: minimum, maximum, median, mean, SD (\code{\link{summarize_wts}})
