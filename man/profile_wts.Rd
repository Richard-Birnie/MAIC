\title{Produce a data frame of the weights assigned to patient profiles}
\usage{
profile_wts(data, wt_col = "wt", wt_rs = "wt_rs", vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing individual patient data from
the intervention study, including a column containing the weights (derived
using \code{\link{estimate_weights}}).}

\item{wt_col}{The name of the weights column in the data frame containing the
intervention individual patient data and the MAIC propensity weights. The
default is wt.}

\item{vars}{A character vector giving the variable names of the baseline
characteristics (not centered). These names must match the column names in
the data.}

\item{rs_wt_col}{The name of the rescaled weights column in the data frame
containing the intervention individual patient data and the MAIC propensity
weights. The default is wt_rs.}
}
\value{
A data frame that includes a summary of patient characteristics
  associated with each weight value.
}
\description{
Select the patient characteristics used in the matching and the MAIC weights
and output a data frame of unique propensity weight values with the
associated summary baseline characteristics. This data frame helps to
understand how different patient profiles are contributing to the analyses by
illustrating the patient characteristics associated with different weight
values. For example, min, max and median weights. This function is most
useful when only matching on binary variables as there are fewer unique
values.

#### Prepare the data ----------------------------------------------------------

### Intervention data

# Read in relevant ADaM data and rename variables of interest
adsl <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "adsl.csv", package = "MAIC",
                             mustWork = TRUE))
adrs <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "adrs.csv", package = "MAIC",
                             mustWork = TRUE))
adtte <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "adtte.csv", package = "MAIC",
                              mustWork = TRUE))

adsl <- adsl \%>\% # Data containing the matching variables
  mutate(SEX=ifelse(SEX=="Male", 1, 0)) # Coded 1 for males and 0 for females

adrs <- adrs \%>\% # Response data
  filter(PARAM=="Response") \%>\%
  transmute(USUBJID, ARM, response=AVAL)

adtte <- adtte \%>\% # Time to event data (overall survival)
  filter(PARAMCD=="OS") \%>\%
  mutate(Event=1-CNSR) \%>\% #Set up coding as Event = 1, Censor = 0
  transmute(USUBJID, ARM, Time=AVAL, Event)

# Combine all intervention data
intervention_input <- adsl \%>\%
  full_join(adrs, by=c("USUBJID", "ARM")) \%>\%
  full_join(adtte, by=c("USUBJID", "ARM"))

# List out the variables in the intervention data that have been identified as
# prognostic factors or treatment effect modifiers and will be used in the
# matching
match_cov <- c("AGE",
               "SEX",
               "SMOKE",
               "ECOG0")

## Baseline data from the comparator trial
# Baseline aggregate data for the comparator population
target_pop <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "Aggregate data.csv",
                                     package = "MAIC", mustWork = TRUE))

# Rename target population cols to be consistent with match_cov
target_pop_standard <- target_pop \%>\%
        rename(
           N=N,
           Treatment=ARM,
           AGE=age.mean,
           SEX=prop.male,
           SMOKE=prop.smoke,
           ECOG0=prop.ecog0
              ) \%>\%
        transmute(N, Treatment, AGE, SEX, SMOKE, ECOG0)


#### Estimate weights ----------------------------------------------------------

### Center baseline characteristics
# (subtract the aggregate comparator data from the corresponding column of
# intervention PLD)
intervention_data <- intervention_input \%>\%
    mutate(
     Age_centered = AGE - target_pop$age.mean,
     # matching on both mean and standard deviation for continuous variables (optional)
     Age_squared_centered = (AGE^2) - (target_pop$age.mean^2 + target_pop$age.sd^2),
     Sex_centered = SEX - target_pop$prop.male,
     Smoke_centered = SMOKE - target_pop$prop.smoke,
     ECOG0_centered = ECOG0 - target_pop$prop.ecog0)

## Define the matching covariates
cent_match_cov <- c("Age_centered",
                    "Age_squared_centered",
                    "Sex_centered",
                    "Smoke_centered",
                    "ECOG0_centered")

## Optimization procedure
# Following the centering of the baseline characteristics of the intervention
# study, patient weights can be estimated using estimate_weights
# The function output is a list containing (1) a data set of the individual
# patient data with the assigned weights "analysis_data" and (2) a vector
# containing the matching variables "matching_vars"
est_weights <- estimate_weights(intervention_data = intervention_data,
                                matching_vars = cent_match_cov)
