\usage{
profile_wts(data, wt = wt, wt_rs = wt_rs, vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{intervention_wts}{A data frame containing individual patient data from
the intervention study, including a column containing the weights (derived
using estimate_weights).}

\item{wt_col}{The name of the weights column in the data frame containing the
intervention individual patient data and the MAIC propensity weights. The
default is WT.}

\item{rs_wt_col}{The name of the rescaled weights column in the data frame
containing the intervention individual patient data and the MAIC propensity
weights. The default is WT_RS.}

\item{matching_vars}{A character vector giving the names of the covariates to
use in matching. These names must match the column names in
intervention_data and baseline_comparator.}
}
\value{
A data frame that includes a summary of patient characteristics
  associated with alternative weight values.
}
\description{
Select the patient characteristics used in the matching and the MAIC weights
and output a data frame of unique propensity weight values with the
associated summary baseline characteristics. This data frame helps to
understand how different patient profiles are contributing to the analyses by
illustrating the patient characteristics associated with different weight
values. For example, min, max and median weights. This function is most
useful when only matching on binary variables as there are fewer unique
values.
